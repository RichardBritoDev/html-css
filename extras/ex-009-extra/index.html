    <p>Grimm first appears when the Troupe is summoned to Hallownest by the Knight lighting the Nightmare Lantern in a hidden area in the Howling Cliffs, after which they set up camp in Dirtmouth. Inside the main tent is Grimm, who greets the Knight and explains that the Grimmkin now travel across Hallownest to collect the "flame in dream". He gives the Knight the Grimmchild charm, and encourages them to seek and defeat the three Grimmkin who have gathered flames in order to upgrade the Grimmchild.

        After defeating the three Grimmkin and collecting their flames, Grimm appears when the Knight and the Grimmchild return to his tent and uses the flames to upgrade Grimmchild into a deadly companion. He then sends the Knight out to find three more flames to further grow the Grimmchild so he can begin the performance. Following the next three flames, Grimm leads the Grimmchild into his body and challenges the Knight in a duel. After being defeated, Grimm congrats the Knight and mentions how they have the potential in prolonging the Nightmare Heart. He awards them with a charm notch and returns the Grimmchild, now in its third form, and encourages the Knight to seek out the last three flames so the Ritual could begin.
        
        Following Grimm's boss fight, the player is given two options to complete Grimm's quest: the first is to collect the remaining three flames and return to Grimm, who now sleeps in the back room of his tent. Dream Nailing him takes the Knight to Grimm's dream in the nightmare realm, where they must fight against Nightmare King Grimm to complete the performance and finish the Ritual. Defeating him there will transfer the Nightmare's Heart from Grimm to the Grimmchild, granting the Knight the fourth and final form of the Grimmchild. Defeating Grimm causes the Grimm Troupe to vanish, although Divine will stay behind and upgrade the fragile charms.
        
        However, talking with Brumm in the Deepnest before collecting all three flames and following him to Howling Cliffs to quench the flame of the Nightmare Lantern will cancel the Ritual and banish the Troupe. The Nightmare Lantern is the anchor through which the Grimm Troupe can manifest in the waking world, and destroying this anchor banishes the Troupe back to the nightmare realm.</p>
